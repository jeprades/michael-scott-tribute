        <p>
          Regional Manager at Dunder Mifflin Sabre. Founder and CEO of Michael
          Scott Paper Company and former branch manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper
          Company. When I grew up I want to get married and have 100 kids so I
          could then have 100 friends and none of them could say no to being my
          friends. I did not attend college as I lost all my tuition money in a
          pyramid scheme.

              Broad decision-making authority on branch operations. I place
              those responsabilities secondary to my desire to be friends with
              my employees. On the other hand, I also overstep my authority by
              hosting events that Corporate disapproves.

            Company founded to compete with my former employer after being
            humiliated. We set our prices too low and decided to declare
            bankruptcy. My former employer afraid of our talent wanted to buy
            the company out. I displayed a remarkable ability to negotiate with
            Dunder Mifflin and convinced the company to hire me and my
            employees.

              In charge of Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin. Loyal to the
              company, trying to help my employeed when they endure
              difficulties. I spend 80 percent of my time “distracting others,”
              19 percent of my time “procrastinating,” and 1 percent of my time
              “critical thinking.” Still, we have the best sales records of the
              entire company.

            anything they want about any subject. So you know you are getting

            The best magician in the world. He tried to escape fro ma

            say Jim Halpert hid it.

            Dwight has the most respect for me, viewing me as a model for
            success, and is thrilled when asked to handle my tasks, however
            ill-conceived it may be. Although on the surface I usually appear
            dismissive of Dwight and generally view him as a suck-up, I'm
            genuinely hurt and angry at the few times when Dwight refused to
            reveal office secrets to my new company, the Michael Scott Paper
            Company.

          <p>
            I have a crush on Ryan, which makes Ryan uncomfortable, something
            that I don't understand why. I gave him a $400 iPod for the staff's
            Christmas Secret Santa exchange, despite an agreed upon office limit
            of $20 per person, and in "The Dundies", I gave Ryan the "Hottest in
            the Office" award. He is my best friend. He is just as hot as Jan,
            but in a different way.

            <h3>Toby Flenderson</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            I fiercely hate Human Resources Manager Toby Flenderson as he
            enforces the rules of proper office behavior that I love to flout.
            He works for corporate so he's really not part of our family. He's
            also divorced so he's not a part of his family either. My longtime
            goal is to get rid of Toby. I was thrilled when Toby decided to move
            to Costa Rica, I even gave him a rock with a note that reads "Suck
            on this". But he returned and I was completely horrified. I tried to
            frame him for possession of marijuana. It didn't work.
